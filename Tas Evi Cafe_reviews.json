    "review_text": "This is the perfect place to enjoy the sunset. They have a rooftop terrace that is actually the attraction of this place. It is a peaceful place, with an astonishing view to the old town and the old citadel on the hill. I say that the atmosphere here, at sunset is something not to miss. \nHave the google translate ready, only one of them spoke English, but they are all very welcoming and kind. \nThey have very very good Turkish and Kurdish coffee and good tea.\nDevamını okuyun"
